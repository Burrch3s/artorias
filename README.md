# Artorias IoT Security Testing Framework


####  Test specific targets, or subnet of targets

-Identify OS Type
-Services provided

#### Identify Vulnerabilities (Black Box)

-Identify open ports
-Identify plaintext traffic to/from device
-Drive IoT scanners
-Try Cracking loggin for weak passwords
-Test webinterface, if provided


## Future ideas

#### Identify Vulnerabilities (White Box)

-Use given credentials on hosts to loggin
-Perform basic checks (maybe try using Nessus?)

#### Web Front End

-May not be possible in timeframe wanted, but eh let's try

#### Compile and Rank Results

-Take everything that is listed above and provide meaningful feedback
-Consult NIST, OWASP and other guidelines in attempt to rank findings
